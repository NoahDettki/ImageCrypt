# ImageCrypt
Hide secret messages in a PNG image

This is a streamlit app where you can upload a PNG image and hide a secret message in it.
You can then download the new image and share it with someone else.
Uploading the new image in the "Decrypt"-expander will reveal the secret message.

Be aware though that lossy image compression will make it impossible to decrypt the secret message.
